### EPL Portfolio
*Samples of my analytics and visualization work done with the Edmonton Public Library.*  

[📊 Item Movement and In-Branch Collection Size](https://github.com/DanielCairns/portfolio/blob/main/EPL%20Item%20Movement%20and%20In-Branch%20Collection%20Size.pdf)  
Thorough analysis of item movement and collection size across the EPL system. This analysis informed where items pooled, how frequently each collection moved, what percentage of each collection is in the library (vs. checked out, missing, or in-transit), and how much total item capacity we need to hold the current collection.  

[📝 Computer Usage Report](https://github.com/DanielCairns/portfolio/blob/main/RIV%20Computer%20Requirements%20Oct%202023.pdf)  
My report recommending how many public workstations are required in the Riverbend library, based on overall and peak usage in the previous 12 months.

Below is an example of the analysis which generated the recommendations. Notice how the Mill Woods library has 43 total computers but the peak concurrent users each day tops out at 36, so my algorithm suggested we reduce the workstation count to 32.

Jupyter Notebook containing my code and analysis running my neural network model to predict Antarctic climate as part of my master's capstone project. This was the initial "proof of concept" workbook I presented to our capstone partner on May 22 2023.

[📊 Live App](https://fantasy-hockey-goalies.onrender.com/)

Interactive dashboard I built for course DSCI 532 - Data Visualization II. It's designed to help me anticipate the distribution of fantasy points a goalie in my fantasy hockey league might score given their team and/or their opponent.

## Presentations

### Edmonton Tableau User Group - February 28, 2022

I delivered a 30 minute presentation to the Edmonton Tableau User Group on "Tableau for the Grocery Industry", explaining three case studies on how we used Tableau to improve our operations while I was working as a Business Analyst at Freson Bros.
